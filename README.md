# Task_Scheduling
# Greedy Task Scheduling Algorithm

This project implements a **Greedy Algorithm** for **task scheduling**, where tasks are allocated to workers to balance workload efficiently. The algorithm assigns tasks based on **Largest Processing Time First (LPT)** and then distributes them among workers with the **least load** at each step.

## ðŸš€ Features
- Greedy approach for **optimal task allocation**
- **Balances workload** across workers
- **Efficient sorting** of tasks for better scheduling
- Simple **CLI-based input/output**

## ðŸ“Œ How It Works
1. **Sort tasks** in descending order based on their processing time.
2. **Assign tasks** to the worker with the **least current load**.
3. Repeat until **all tasks are assigned**.
